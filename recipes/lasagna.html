            <li>16 oz lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>15 oz part-skim Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp dried parsley</li>

            <li>2 oz Romano cheese , finely shredded (packed 1/2 cup), plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large enameled cast iron pot over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, crumble beef and sausage into pot, season lightly with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally until browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and drain into a large bowl lined with plenty of paper towels. Pour drained beef and sausage into a food processor and pulse mixture about 10 - 15 seconds until ground into small pieces, set aside.</li>
            <li>Return pot to medium-high heat, add in remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil. Once oil is hot, add onion and saute until golden, about 2 - 3 minutes, adding garlic during the last 30 seconds of sauteing.</li>
            <li>Add tomato puree, tomato paste, sugar, basil, crushed fennel seeds, oregano, thyme, marjoram, then season with 1 tsp salt and more to taste and 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper. Add cooked meat.</li>
            <li>Bring mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered 45 minutes - 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta to al dente according to directions listed on package (now is a good time to shred cheese). Drain pasta (do not rinse) and once cool enough to handle, align noodles in a single layer on sheets of wax paper (you can also hang some of them over the colander used to strain pasta).</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl using a fork, blend together Ricotta cheese, egg and parsley, set aside. In a mixing bowl or large ziploc bag, toss together mozzarella, Parmesan and Romano cheese, set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To assemble lasagna, evenly spread 1 cup ground beef pasta sauce into the bottom of a 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Align 4 - 5* lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over lasagna noodle layer (it will be a thin layer) then sprinkle 1/4 of the mozzarela cheese mixture into an even layer. </li>
            <li>Dollop and spread 1 1/2 cups pasta sauce evenly over cheese, then repeat this layering process 2 more times. Finish top with 1 more layer of 4 - 5 lasagna noodles, then spread 1/2 cup pasta sauce over top of noodles and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese mixture. Tent baking dish with foil (don't allow foil to touch cheese on top.)</li>
            <li>Also if you may want to rest it on a baking sheet if it's looking very full in the baking dish to prevent it from spilling over) and bake in preheated oven 35 minutes, then remove foil and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Serve warm garnished with additional Romano cheese and fresh parsley or basil if desired.</li>
