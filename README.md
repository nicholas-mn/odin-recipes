# odin-recipes

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository, is for me to showcase that I have mastered the following from The Odin Project:

- Git
- Git commit messages
- Github
- Basic HTML


I am not a complete newby, as I already am pretty well-versed with Linux, Docker etc.
My reasoning for going through The Odin Project, is that I have always wanted to learn to develop **for real**, but never took the time to sit down.  
I always focused mostly on doing Linux stuff, like changing configs, distro-hopping and self-hosting various services with Docker.
